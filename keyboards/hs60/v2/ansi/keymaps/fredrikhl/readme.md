My keymap for the HS60v3
========================

Base layer
----------
The base layer is a fairly sane and normal 60% ansi layout, but:

- LALT and LGUI is swapped (for osx)
- No weird stuff on grave/tilde key, as is common on 60% layouts
- Escape on CAPS
- Layer1 mode on RGUI
- Layer2 mode on APP
- Layer3 mode on RGUI + APP


Layer 1
-------
Function Layer

- F1-F12 on `1`-`0`, MINS, EQL
- Escape on GRV
- Caps lock back where it usually would be
- Arrows on WASD cluster
- Arrows on HJKL cluster
- mute on `m`, volume down on `,`, volume up on `.` 

Layer 2
-------
Function Layer

- PGUP/PGDN/HOME/END on WASD cluster


Layer 3
-------
QMK/Board layer

- Reset on GRV
- EEP Reset on TAB
- Lights on `f`-`j`, `z`-SLSH
- most other keys are noop, except for modifiers and keys that aren't overridden
  in layer1
